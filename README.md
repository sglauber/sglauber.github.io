GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

The main goal of this project/repository is to practice frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but it was also used to practice git version control system.
It'll probably be turned into a notepad-ish site of some sort to keep track of the knowledge that's going to be built.
